# Pokedex Project

This project is a Next.js application leveraging the new App Router for creating a Pokedex that consumes the PokeAPI. It showcases the oldest images from the Pokémon games, providing a nostalgic touch for fans. The application is designed with Server-Side Rendering (SSR) for optimal performance and uses lazy loading for images to enhance user experience. This setup ensures quick, efficient access to Pokémon data while maintaining the aesthetic of the classic games.
